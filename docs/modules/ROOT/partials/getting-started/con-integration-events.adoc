= {registry} Integration Events

{registry} can be configured to produce events when specific actions happen in the registry, this allows for custom or third party integrations with {registry}.

You can configure {registry} to send events to your applications when artifacts are created, updated, deleted,...

//Only artifact metadata will be send in the event payload, applications will have to query the registry after receiving an event to obtain the artifact content.

The are different protocols available for the transport of the events, the current implemented protocols are: http and kafka. Regardless of the protocol events are send using the CloudEvents specification.

The event types are:

* io.apicurio.registry.artifact-created
* io.apicurio.registry.artifact-updated
//TODO artifact-deleted
